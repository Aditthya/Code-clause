import Libraries:

import nltk
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
- nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit library, used for natural language processing tasks.
- Chat and reflections: Modules from NLTK specifically for creating chatbots.
Define Patterns and Responses:

patterns = [
    (r'hi|hello|hey', ['Hello!', 'Hi there!', 'Hey!']),
    (r'how are you', ['I am good, thank you!', 'Doing well, thanks.']),
    (r'what is your name', ['I am a chatbot.', 'You can call me ChatGPT.']),
    (r'quit|bye', ['Goodbye!', 'Bye!', 'See you later.']),
    # Add more patterns and responses as needed
]
- patterns: List of tuples where each tuple contains a regular expression pattern and a list of possible responses.
For example, if the user's input matches the pattern 'hi', 'hello', or 'hey', the chatbot will respond with a random greeting from the corresponding list.
Create Chatbot:
chatbot = Chat(patterns, reflections)
- Chat: Creates a chatbot instance using the defined patterns and reflections.
Start Conversation Function:

def start_chat():
    print("Hello! I'm your chatbot. You can start chatting. Type 'quit' to exit.")
    while True:
        user_input = input('You: ')
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            print("Chatbot: Goodbye!")
            break
        response = chatbot.respond(user_input)
        print("Chatbot:", response)
- start_chat: A function to initiate the conversation with the user.
- It prompts the user to input messages and responds accordingly until the user types 'quit'.
Main Execution:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nltk.download('punkt')  # Download NLTK data if not already downloaded
    start_chat()  # Start the chat
- Checks if the script is being run as the main program.
- Downloads NLTK data (specifically 'punkt' tokenizer) if not already downloaded.
- Initiates the chat by calling the start_chat function.
